  <title>Communication protocol</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This article describes the communication protocol used to for
      communications between the host (PC) and the device (MCU).

    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      We need to send data to the device. This data will be HPGL or
      G-code. Besides that, it would be nice to have low level control
      of the device from the host, so we need to select between two
      different types of transmitted data.
    </para>
    <para>
      It would be nice to have checksum validation. Only one
      connection/session is required.

    <title>SNAP (Scalable Node Address Protocol)</title>
    <para>
      This protocol may be used. It features error correction with
      checksum and ACK/NAK signals.
    </para>
    <para>
      We want to be able to send two different kinds of data, but SNAP
      does not support this. It could be implemented by using one of
      the 128 available command codes to select stream. Then SNAP
      becomes a multistream protocol, and we just use two streams.
