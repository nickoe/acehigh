# Welcome to the Ace High project #

This project aims to provide mechanical and electrical documentation and software documentation and implementations for a 2d plotter. Ace High has not yet reached alpha.

This project is a spin-off from the original project owners' final project in electronics at [Aalborg Technical College](http://www.aatg.dk/English) (in Danish: [Aalborg Tekniske Gymnasium](http://www.aatg.dk)).

Most contents (including the wiki and source code comments) is written in Danish, but limited translations will be made on request.

Like previous projects, this project is named after [some old western](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_High_(1968_film)).

A video showind the dirst generation Ace High drawing a beautiful penguin is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8gJVtnyS2o.
